/*
 * Q3)Creating one superclass Hill stations and three subclasses Manali, Mussoorie, Gulmarg.
	    Subclasses extend the superclass and override its location() and famousfor() method. 
	   We will call the location() and famousfor() method by the Parent classâ€™, i.e. Hillstations class. 
	   As it refers to the base class object and the base class method overrides the superclass method;
	   the base class method is invoked at runtime.
